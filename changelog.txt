CHANGELOG

*** v0.3.2 (1/25/2015) ***
- Fixed erroneous baud rate configuration (was accidentally left at 57,600)
- Added missing setFrame() commands for STATUS and ECHOFRAME outgoing frames

*** v0.3.1 (1/25/2015) ***
- Slowed STATUS frame transmission rate to 20 Hz/once every 50 loops (down from 100 Hz)

*** v0.3.0 (1/25/2015) ***
- Started Logging Various Changes
- Increased UART0 baud rate to 921,600
- Converted IMU frame values from 3 32-bit ints to 6 16-bit shorts (angular velocities are only recorded with 16 bits of accuracy)
- Added translational accelerations to IMU frame (originally just angular velocities)
- Added a STATUS frame for reporting "status" variable, battery voltage, and CPU load
- Added an ECHOFRAME frame for returning five characters received in a given ECHO frame
